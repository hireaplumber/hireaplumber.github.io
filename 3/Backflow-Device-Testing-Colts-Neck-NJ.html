<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, but its steep price makes it not practical as a household service.

<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
