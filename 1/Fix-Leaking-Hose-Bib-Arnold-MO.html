<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
