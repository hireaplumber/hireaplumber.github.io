<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Garden City MI</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it also.</p>
