<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Poteet TX 78065</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
