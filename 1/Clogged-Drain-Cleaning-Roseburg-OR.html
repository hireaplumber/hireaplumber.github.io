The kitchen sink drain might need a simple tightening up or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the evident spray.

<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span.
