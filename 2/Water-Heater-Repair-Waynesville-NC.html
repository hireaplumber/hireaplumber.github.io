<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
