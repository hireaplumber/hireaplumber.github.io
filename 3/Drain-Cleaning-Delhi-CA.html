<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Burst Pipe Hydraulic Replacement - Like pipe relining, this also doesn't involve digging and changing. Rather, our specialists utilize a breaking tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and break apart.

As rust and minerals build up with time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health danger in your water.</p>
