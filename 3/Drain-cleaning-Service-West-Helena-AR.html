<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
