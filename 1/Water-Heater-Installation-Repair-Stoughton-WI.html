<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank.
