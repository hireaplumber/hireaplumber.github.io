<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
