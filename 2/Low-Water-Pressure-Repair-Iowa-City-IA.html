<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
