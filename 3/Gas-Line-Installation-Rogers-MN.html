<p>There are certain plumbers who concentrate on plumbing associated with house improvement and brand-new building and construction. When a new house is developed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber might be a terrific candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more specialized plumber should be used for house remodeling work.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow.

The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
