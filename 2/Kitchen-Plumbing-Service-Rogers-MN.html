<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the offender. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that streams through the softener.
