<p>You probably understand something about your drains: they take water from your sinks, bath tubs, and showers to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working appropriately that's truly all you need to know about them, but when something fails, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the know-how to identify a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
