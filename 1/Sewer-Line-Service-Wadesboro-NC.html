Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
