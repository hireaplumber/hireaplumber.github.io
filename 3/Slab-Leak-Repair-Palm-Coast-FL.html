<p>The fuel line of your cars and truck supplies gas from the fuel tank to the carburetor, making the combustion essential for the engine to run. You may have a gas leak from the fuel line if you smell a strong whiff of gas from your cars and truck when it is running. It is vital to repair this right away to avoid an explosion. It is best to take your vehicle to a certified mechanic if you are not specific of your repair abilities.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
