Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
