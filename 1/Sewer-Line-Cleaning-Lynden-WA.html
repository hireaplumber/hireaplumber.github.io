They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
