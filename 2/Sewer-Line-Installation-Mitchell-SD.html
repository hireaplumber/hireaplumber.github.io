<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage ought to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing.
