<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads.
