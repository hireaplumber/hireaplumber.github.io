Exemptions, which are approved in exceptionally rare cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a danger to the water system, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
