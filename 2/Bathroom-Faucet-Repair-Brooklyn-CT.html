Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. You need to wait up until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration.
