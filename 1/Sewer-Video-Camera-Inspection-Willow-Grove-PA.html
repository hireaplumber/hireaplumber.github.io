Instead, our technicians utilize a bursting tool that forces the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate.

This repair technique is normally utilized to replace the old pipe with a comparable or larger pipe.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a high-tech, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are removed to connect the pipes to the water components, Wood says. Depending on the scope of work being performed and the type of building, you might have one or more inspections.</p>
