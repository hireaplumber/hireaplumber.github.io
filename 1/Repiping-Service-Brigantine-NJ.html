<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the easiest of the 3 offered techniques. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need fewer repairs with time. Sanford & Son plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
