<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>Depending on the degree of the clog, we might use a variety of various methods, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced kind of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to completely clean out everything inside your drains.
