<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>Today, most professionals advise a careful inspection of residential water heaters regularly - at least annually. Malfunctioning water heaters cause a range of problems. These concerns run the gamut from undependable or sluggish water heating to costly water leakages and potential fire hazards.
