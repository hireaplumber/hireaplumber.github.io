<p>Weird Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through. Since of the tight space, the pipes typically make weird gurgling sounds as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, resulting in the odd noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline type that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and circulation typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regrowth.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed properly (Picture 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
