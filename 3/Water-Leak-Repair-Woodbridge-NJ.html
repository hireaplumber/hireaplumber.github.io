Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and available for use. Also, rust of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of corrosion.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
