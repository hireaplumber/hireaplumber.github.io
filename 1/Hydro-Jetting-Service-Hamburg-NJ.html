For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
