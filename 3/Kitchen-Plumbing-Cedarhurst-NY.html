For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
