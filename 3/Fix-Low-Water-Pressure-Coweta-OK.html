<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
