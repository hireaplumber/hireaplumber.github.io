<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the property, enabling it to stream backward into city water materials.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
