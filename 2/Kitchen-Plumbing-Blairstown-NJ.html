<p>When the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place.

<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>A number of organizations, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) provide accreditation courses developed to train professionals to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
