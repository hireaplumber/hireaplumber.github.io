<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off.
