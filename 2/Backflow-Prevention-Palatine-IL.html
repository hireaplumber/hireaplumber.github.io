The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
