<p>With tank hot water heaters, you have a large tank that heats up and holds water. The heating element can be through using electrical energy, gas, or oil. The gas water heaters use natural gas or LPG to heat up the water. The gas models are likewise less costly to operate than the electrical types and are a favorite for commercial and residential purposes. As for the benefits of electrical tank water heaters, they are much safer and simpler to preserve compared to their gas equivalents.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or stained water, it normally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup.
