<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
