Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
