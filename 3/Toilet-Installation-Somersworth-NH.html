<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally kept at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
