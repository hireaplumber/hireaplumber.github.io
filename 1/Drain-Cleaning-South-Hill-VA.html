<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Note: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and disinfected during regrowth. Lastly, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
