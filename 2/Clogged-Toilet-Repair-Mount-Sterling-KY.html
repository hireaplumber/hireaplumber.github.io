When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
