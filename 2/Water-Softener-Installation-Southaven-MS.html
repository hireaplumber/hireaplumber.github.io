<h3>Hydro Scrub Jetting in Southaven Mississippi</h2>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Even if copper is showing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes. You may need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of piping that are utilized in the repiping procedure. Because of their safety, efficiency and cost, copper piping and PEX piping are used. Copper piping avoids bacteria from growing inside of the pipe providing healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both light-weight and versatile. This material is resistant against corrosion and will help improve water pressure.</p>
