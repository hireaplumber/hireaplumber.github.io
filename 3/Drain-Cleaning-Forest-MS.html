At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

First, plans for each device to be set up must be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to three weeks or more to approve and process.

<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department should satisfy or exceed the state standards and carry the duty for implementing them.</p>
