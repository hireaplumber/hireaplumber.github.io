Our repair procedures depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls effectively. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all instructions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
