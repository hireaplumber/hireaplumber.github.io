<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
