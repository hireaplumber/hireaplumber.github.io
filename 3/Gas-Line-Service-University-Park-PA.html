<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and scenarios that need backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is very important for owners to alert the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial property, the District examines making use of each new renter. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction needs to be made before water service is allowed. Cost for the device is covered by either the residential or commercial property or the tenant owner.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The fundamental methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow.

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
