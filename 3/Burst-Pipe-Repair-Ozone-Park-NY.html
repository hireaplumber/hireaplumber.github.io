<p>Many structures are closed to the general public or have restricted access in order to help slow the spread of COVID-19. To avoid Legionella development, these systems need to be actively handled and maintained. See details and assistance to decrease Legionella development and other pathogen and rust issues that happen when there is a large drop in building water usage.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential clients with known backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
