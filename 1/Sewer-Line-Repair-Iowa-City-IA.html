<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>On and off does any structural damage take place as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is typically detected prior to it causes any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This little hole enables water to constantly leak out extremely gradually. In time it can lead to a considerable build of water. Leaked water usually remains under your home and saturates into the ground soil. This can possibly trigger a cavity if your house's structure was not appropriately compressed. This is a rare occasion and in general, there is little issue over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
