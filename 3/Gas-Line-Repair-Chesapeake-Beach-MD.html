The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial costs can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for locals. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist identify.</p>
