It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
