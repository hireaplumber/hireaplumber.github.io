<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Arlington TN 38002</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
