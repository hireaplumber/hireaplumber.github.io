When these parts break, they lead to tiny leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. Because they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regrow after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
