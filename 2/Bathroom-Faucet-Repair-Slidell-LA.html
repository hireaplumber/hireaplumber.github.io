Secondary backflow methods provide an increased level of defense for the public water supply system.</p>

When washing dishes, you'll most likely notice lower water pressure in the shower or. The very best service is to replace your plumbing with new pipes that don't have buildup.</p>

This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
