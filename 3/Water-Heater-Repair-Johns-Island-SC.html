<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Johns Island SC 29455</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
