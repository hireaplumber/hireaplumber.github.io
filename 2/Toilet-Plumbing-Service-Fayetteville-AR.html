The City of Jacksonville Building Inspection Division has needed the installation of backflow preventers on all commercial fire sprinkler service lines, watering lines and drinkable water lines. Commercial assemblies should be tested every year.</p>
<p>Because of the fundamental design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or static flow condition might cause problem dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
