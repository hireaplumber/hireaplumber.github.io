Other products are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Certain pipe products have greater coefficients of heat strain, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and stress as an outcome of temperature level change and ice development.

Such testing should be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester registered with the City of Austin.

Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow diagram is needed to ensure it was repaired appropriately. An appropriately fixed assembly must provide years of protection.</p>
