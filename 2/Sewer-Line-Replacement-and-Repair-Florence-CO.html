<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for most construction contractors (or their workers). The secret to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer.

<p>The most efficient way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire combating water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance coverage Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
