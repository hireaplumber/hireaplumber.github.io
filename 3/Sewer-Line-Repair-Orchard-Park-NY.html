<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that counts on extremely technical proficiency and specialized devices to determine the location of leakages throughout the city's water distribution system and determine the area of those leaks at which visible water might or might not have surfaced.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
