<p>Sinks aren't as simple as they used to be. Nowadays, house owners can choose from a dizzying series of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you might have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is typically a sign of a clog in the plumbing system. If the clog isn't removed, water pressure can build up within the pipe, eventually triggering it to burst.</p>
