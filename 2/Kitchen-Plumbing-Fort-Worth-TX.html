<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a requirement more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
