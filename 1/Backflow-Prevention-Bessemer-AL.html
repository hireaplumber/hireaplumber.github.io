<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task.
