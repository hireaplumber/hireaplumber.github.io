Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
