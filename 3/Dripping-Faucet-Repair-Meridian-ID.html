<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for most fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
