Cold showers? High energy expenses? It may be time for a new hot water heater. But in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up effectively.

Even if the problem originates with the community system, it's still clever to generate the experts to limit the damage to your house.</p>

<p>Knowing: Soft water is an ease to live with, hard water is not.

Bill Howe suggests changing old water turned off valves under sinks and behind toilets every 5-7 years. Burst water shutoffs are among the leading reasons for house flooding.</p>
