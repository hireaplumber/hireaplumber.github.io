<p>Drain cleaning is an effective method to eliminate any clogs, or debris that have developed in your plumbing system.

<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out annual forward flow tests are often viewed as a required to have them. But the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>There are certain plumbers who focus on plumbing connected with house improvement and new construction. When a new house is constructed, pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be installed correctly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber may be a great candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more specialized plumber should be used for house remodeling work.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) provide certification courses designed to train professionals to evaluate backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
