<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to fluctuating pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve becomes part of the unit for that specific reason. But while small drips must not be cause for issue, house owners ought to keep an eye on the hot water heater leakages. I had a fantastic experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we required a leak in a pipe fixed. Tom was professional and friendly. He also got the job done faster than original estimated, so the work was more economical than I expected. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>

The pilot burner may need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is harmed, the flowers or plants near the gas leak will be stained or degraded. Contact our specialists to figure out the degree of the issue.</p>
