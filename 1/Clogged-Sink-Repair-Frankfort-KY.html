A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complicated concerns with water temperature or pressure might require replacing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
