<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
