<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow.
