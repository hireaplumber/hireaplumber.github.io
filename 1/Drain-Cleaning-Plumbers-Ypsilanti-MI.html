The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to the City of Bellingham.
