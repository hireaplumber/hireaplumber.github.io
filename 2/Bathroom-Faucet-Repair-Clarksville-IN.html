Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally rare cases where the structure is considered to not posture a danger to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
