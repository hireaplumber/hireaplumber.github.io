<p>High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water entering the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure results in leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to take place without proper pressure reduction.

<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
