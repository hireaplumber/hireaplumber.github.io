<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal proof that specific magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be effective in preventing scale formation in difficult water supply. It is really tough to evaluate such claims, which are practically never based on tests that are well sufficient explained to enable others to assess them and to confirm the outcomes. While the absence of "scientific" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it must make one be reluctant to accept it without some assurance of performance.</p>

How much does it cost to repipe a home with PEX? About the exact same price, although you'll likely pay more because it's a more durable, better quality material. An excellent rule of thumb is that you can expect to pay from 40 cents to $2.20 per-linear-foot to repipe a home.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
