<h3>Plumbing Services Around Lake Station IN</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>

<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try dumping a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and after that switch on the waste disposal unit while running water.
