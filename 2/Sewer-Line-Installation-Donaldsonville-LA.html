<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
