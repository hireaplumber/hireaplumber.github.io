<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Hydro-jetting is a method of removing build up and particles in tanks and lines by using incredibly high-pressure water to remove clogs.
