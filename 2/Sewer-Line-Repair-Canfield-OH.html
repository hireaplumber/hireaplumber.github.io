Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Tough water likewise makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>
