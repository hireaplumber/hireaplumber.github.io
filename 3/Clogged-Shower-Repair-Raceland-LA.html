<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.
