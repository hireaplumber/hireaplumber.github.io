<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
