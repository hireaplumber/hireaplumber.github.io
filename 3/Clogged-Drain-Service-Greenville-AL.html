Whether tree roots have made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you shouldn't have, a clogged toilet is never an enjoyable experience. Fortunately, you do not always need the support of a professional to fix it.</p>

This is also not as efficient due to the fact that the drain machine loses torque the even more you are far from the clog.

<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl).

Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
