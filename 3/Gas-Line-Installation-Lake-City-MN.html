<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Lake City MN</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
