<h3>Sewer Clean Out in Xenia Ohio</h2>
<p>There are a number of things that can fail with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last forever. It has remained in place since your house was developed so it has to do with the exact same age as your home. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and rust. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your home.</p>
<p>When you have an issue with your toilet-- whether a clog that can't be repaired with just a plunger, a leak, or a toilet that will not flush-- you need a plumber, quickly.

<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line blockages are not something a property owner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain technician to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially helpful in locating a problem.</p>
