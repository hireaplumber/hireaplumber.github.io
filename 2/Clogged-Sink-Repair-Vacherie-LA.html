It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
