<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners remove calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water saves you cash. Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can happen.</p>
