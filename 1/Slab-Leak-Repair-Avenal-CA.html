<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about securing your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be much more damaging than practical, potentially gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's entire plumbing system, including both water supply and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe deserves the investment in the long run because it may resolve the root reason for the chronic plumbing problems in your house.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>
