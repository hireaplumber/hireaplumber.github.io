<p>Very seldom does any structural damage occur as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is usually spotted before it triggers any substantial damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This little hole enables water to continuously leak out really gradually. In time it can lead to a substantial build of water. Dripped water usually stays under your home and saturates into the ground soil. This can possibly cause a cavity if your house's structure was not properly compressed. This is an unusual occasion and in basic, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts down, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a container beneath the area to catch water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
