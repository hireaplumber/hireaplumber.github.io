<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>Offered there isn't a tank failure, generally a commercial water heater can be repaired, but is it worth repairing? Just after responding to the following questions need to you answer repair or replace. Do you know how many years old your water heater is? Do you know how many years it's rated for?

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
