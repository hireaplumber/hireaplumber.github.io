<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide.

If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
