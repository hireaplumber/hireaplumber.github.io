<p>One common method for a home's supply of water to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread out greatly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in individual houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and infecting the public water system.</p>
<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use certification courses created to train specialists to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
