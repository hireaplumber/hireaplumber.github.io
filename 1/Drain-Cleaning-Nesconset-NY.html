<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>

If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
