<h3>Leaking Toilet in Elizabeth City North Carolina</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
