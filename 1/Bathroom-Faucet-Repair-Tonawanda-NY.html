<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
