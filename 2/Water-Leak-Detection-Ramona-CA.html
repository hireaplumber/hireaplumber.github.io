<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really important part of the style of each component. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
