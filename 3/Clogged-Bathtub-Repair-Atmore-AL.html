<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as water heaters.

Nevertheless, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make sure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
