<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed throughout construction of a new or remodelled structure is set up by knowledgeable artisans in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>
