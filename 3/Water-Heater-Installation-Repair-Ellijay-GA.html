<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Ellijay GA</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these negative results. Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a security preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas an odor often connected with rotten eggs. This distinct fragrance enables you to smell a possible leak if it happens. Always leave if you presume a leak.</p>
<p>Inhaling leaked gas in an indoor area, such as your house can lead to a lack of oxygen in the air and cause hypoxia. That can, in turn, result in extreme headache, fatigue, reduced vision, short breaths, and even loss of consciousness. Keep an eager eye on your gas lines, and call specialists for gas line repair in Richmond at the smallest suspicion.</p>
