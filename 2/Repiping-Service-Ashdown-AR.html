<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<p>Inside the house, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leakages. Check beneath sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber quoted rate of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I inspected around. Under the sink, position a bucket or pan underneath the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
