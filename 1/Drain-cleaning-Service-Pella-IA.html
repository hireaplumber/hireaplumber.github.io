The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs capture moisture so that it doesn't enter the control unit. Although little pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>

You can do a little online research so you can make final adjustments before inspection day if you're getting a rough-in or final inspection on a construction job or remodel. Stopping working a checkup can imply unpleasant delays in your task.</p>
