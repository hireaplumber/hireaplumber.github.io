<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
