<p>If you need a water softener is an individual choice, identifying. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to use salt.
