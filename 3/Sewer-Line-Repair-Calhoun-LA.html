<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable service, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
