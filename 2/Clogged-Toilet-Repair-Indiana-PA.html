<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner set and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.

The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
