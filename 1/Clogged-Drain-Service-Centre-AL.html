<p>Garbage disposal units may cost more when they need to suit local water and sewer capacities. The plumbing in your home must work well or backup can take place, and septic tanks may need to be updated to deal with the disposal.

<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The standard means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
