<p>This type of valve is utilized on farming locations. It is suggested to keep the local water supply clean in the presence of various farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. Making use of these products is called chemigation. There are numerous parts to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which allows circulation in only one direction. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last part is the injection port. This is where the chemicals are introduced to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
