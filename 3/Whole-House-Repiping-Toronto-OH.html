<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard task because of the age of the house and location of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>Rusting and rust on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a possible concern with the water heater. It can also suggest the water heater is near completion of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old. With heavy deterioration accumulation on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could mean that there have been fluctuations in pressure triggering little leakages.</p>
