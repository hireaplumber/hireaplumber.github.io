<p>Many property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or dirty drain problems. These chemicals are easy to utilize and economical, but they harm your pipes and their results are just short-term.

<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
