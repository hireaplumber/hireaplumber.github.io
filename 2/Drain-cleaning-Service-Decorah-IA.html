The pipes can be sourced in your area by the contractor or the homeowner can buy the products.</p>
<p>In some cases, a gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. This type of situation may take place if a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and unintentionally burst a line. A house owner's policy may cover this kind of repair. In addition, if a rupture is developed by an utility company, it might be covered.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
