<p>The program accomplishes its objective by attending to the adoption and promulgation of appropriate rules and regulations for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It might be time for a brand-new warm water heater. But in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed properly. A hot water heater that is not installed properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Over time, like any other home appliance in your house, your waste disposal unit. may need repairs. A disposal system may clog or begin to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, use.

<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink.
