<p>If your assembly fails the annual test, you are responsible for changing the assembly or repairing within thirty days. All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate kind of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see section below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly needs to satisfy the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be ceased until the assembly is in compliance.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
