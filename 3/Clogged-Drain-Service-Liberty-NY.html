<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber Liberty NY</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not posture a danger to the water supply, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
