<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>I think I got swindled. I called thinking it could perhaps be fixed, however they said it would need to be changed.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
