<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face scenarios, quite often that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. Often, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not securely run and get in the basement up until the sewage is extracted and the basement is normally cleaned up.
