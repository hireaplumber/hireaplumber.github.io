Anti-siphon valves should never be set up below ground, even if buried in a box. Gas Line Installation, Repair, and Maintenance. 1. DO usage lots of water each time you grind up food residue, and keep water running for a couple of seconds after the disposal is done. When you're ready to actually install your waste disposal unit, follow these steps listed below courtesy of Lowe's task expert, Hunter Macfarlane. As you check out these steps, if anything offers you stop briefly, do not hesitate to call in a pro. There's no embarassment in getting a little help when you need it.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation.
