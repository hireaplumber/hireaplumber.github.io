The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it pertains to pipe repair, the most costly aspects aren't the machinery or materials utilized, but the uprooting, landscaping and lawn damage that ensues.</p>
