If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
