<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
