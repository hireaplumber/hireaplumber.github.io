<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
