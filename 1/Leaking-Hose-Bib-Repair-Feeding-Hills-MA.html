<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
