<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
