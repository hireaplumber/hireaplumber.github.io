<p>One typical method for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem might spread tremendously. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and infecting the general public water supply.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
