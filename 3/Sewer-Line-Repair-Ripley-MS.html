<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or illness.</p>
