Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
