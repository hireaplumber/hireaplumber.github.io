A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a threat to the water system, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
