<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are specific pollutants that citizens are handling and an RO can help reduce those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be treated with the best RO system.</p>
