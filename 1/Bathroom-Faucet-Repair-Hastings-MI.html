<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
