<p>Re-piping is a procedure of replacing the water supply pipes in a house or building. It is a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a procedure of installing a new water line plumbing system. This process generally consists of eliminating old easily accessible pipes and then setting up the new plumbing system.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
