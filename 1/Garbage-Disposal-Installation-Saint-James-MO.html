<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is a development that simulates biomineralization, the system commonly recognized for structured development in the environment, consisting of seashells.

The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
