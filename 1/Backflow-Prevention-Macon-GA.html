<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for homeowners. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
