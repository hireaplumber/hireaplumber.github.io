<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.
