<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when easy plunging does not seem to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
