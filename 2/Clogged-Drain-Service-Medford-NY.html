<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue.
