<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
