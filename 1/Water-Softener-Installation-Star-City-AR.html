A standard by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
