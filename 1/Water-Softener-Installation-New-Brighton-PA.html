<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in New Brighton</h2>

<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
