<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the issue. You might have to look into using a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. There are two basic piping materials used by plumbing professionals. PEX and copper both provide various benefits and advantages such as eliminating the metallic taste from your water.</p>
