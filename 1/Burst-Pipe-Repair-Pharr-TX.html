<p>The most reliable method to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

In the bathroom, you might have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is usually a sign of a blockage in the plumbing system. If the obstruction isn't eliminated, water pressure can build up within the pipe, eventually triggering it to burst.</p>
