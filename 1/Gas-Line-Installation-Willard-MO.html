For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly.

If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
