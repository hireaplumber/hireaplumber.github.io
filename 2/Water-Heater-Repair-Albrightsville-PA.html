<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might take place.

Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not correctly protected.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to speed up.
