<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
