<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there must be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

Jafco completed a repair on the sewer line at my rental residential or commercial property in Edmonds. The job was completed rapidly and professionally. I would employ them again. Our service technicians might use snakes and root-killing products, or perhaps hydrojetting to dislodge serious drain obstructions that might result in clogged drains or a complete sewage backup. All of these applications are excellent when used properly by a licensed professional. Call Maitz House Services for premium drain cleaning services.</p>
<p>House owners normally offer very little thought to their garbage disposal until it breaks.

Bear in mind that if the disposal is leaking from the seals, our team can have this problem repairs in an extremely short time.
