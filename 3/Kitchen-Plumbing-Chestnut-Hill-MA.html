<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
