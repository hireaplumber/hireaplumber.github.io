<p>While repairing your water heater is generally the cheaper option to make, it isn't always the ideal one depending on your scenario.

You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
