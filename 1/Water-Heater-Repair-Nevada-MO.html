He was then able to remove the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet component.

<p>The water used to regenerate the softener beads winds up as waste.

<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
