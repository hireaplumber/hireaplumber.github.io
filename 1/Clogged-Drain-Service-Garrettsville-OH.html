<p>While pipe lining is an excellent choice for the majority of people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only choice. Repiping is the process of changing old corroded pipes with durable and lasting new pipes. The brand-new pipes that are used are typically made from copper because of their toughness and other factors. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
