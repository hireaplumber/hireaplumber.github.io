<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see however seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This rust can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
