It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well.

I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
