These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
