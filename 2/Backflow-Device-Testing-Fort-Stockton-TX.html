<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
