For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can cause deterioration that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
