<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Bladensburg MD</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
