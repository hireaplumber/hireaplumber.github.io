<p>It is approximated that the average individual invests over 3 years of their life resting on the toilet, and many bathroom readers are at danger of ending up being permanently attached to the fixture. Which is why choosing a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is extremely important. Nevertheless, you have to make certain your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have distinctively shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem.
