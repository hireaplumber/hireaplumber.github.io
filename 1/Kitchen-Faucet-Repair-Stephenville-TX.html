<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
