<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger deterioration that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>If you are considering installing a brand-new hot water heater, think about going tankless. Waste disposal unit must utilize a grounded outlet for power.
