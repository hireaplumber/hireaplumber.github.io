<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Often handles are toilet parts that get loose or corroded and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down effectively. It's an easy repair, however there's a technique to getting the flush deal with out. The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Picture 1). Then remove the old handle and lever, slide the brand-new deal with into location, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
