Our machines run by snaking a turning cable with a connected blade through your pipes. The blades will remove the accumulation due to grease, soap, tree roots, and other foreign objects. Our specialists do not require big holes to place our devices through, rather of counting on entry points through drains, leading to a procedure that is minimally intrusive, maintaining your house and home.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink.
