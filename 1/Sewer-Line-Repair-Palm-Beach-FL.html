<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Palm Beach FL</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
