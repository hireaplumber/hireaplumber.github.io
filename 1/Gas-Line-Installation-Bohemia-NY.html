<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus uses you an optional Pipe Security Prepare for only $3.95 a month.

From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This makes sure that water within lawn sprinkler, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems stays detached from clean" water.</p>

<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

Job well done: You do not wish to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the task to a certified plumber makes sure a smooth installation process.</p>
