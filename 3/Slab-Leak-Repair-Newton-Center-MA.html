<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
