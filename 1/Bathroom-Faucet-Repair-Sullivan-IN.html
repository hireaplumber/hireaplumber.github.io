<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
