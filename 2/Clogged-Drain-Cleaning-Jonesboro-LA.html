<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Jonesboro LA 71251?</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
