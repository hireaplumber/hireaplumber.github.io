<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
