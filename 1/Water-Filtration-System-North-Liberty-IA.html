<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for homeowners. A PE or RA can assist identify if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed correctly (Photo 8). You do not need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
