<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
