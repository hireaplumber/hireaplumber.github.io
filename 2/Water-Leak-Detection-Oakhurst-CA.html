<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
