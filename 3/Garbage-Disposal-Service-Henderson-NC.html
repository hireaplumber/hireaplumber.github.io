<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
