<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you might encounter. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check".

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass constructed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to offer some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to maintain the system.</p>
