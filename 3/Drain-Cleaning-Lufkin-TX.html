<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
