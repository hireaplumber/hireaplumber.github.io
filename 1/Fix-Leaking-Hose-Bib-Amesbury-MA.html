<p>Property owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is specifically prudent to set up inspections on a yearly basis and when buying a brand-new home. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the sodium bicarbonate and vinegar mixture, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are bacteria that feed on raw material, such as hair, mold, algae and other common clog-causers. This natural option is safe and reliable. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to purchase our recommended enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative offers much better, safer drinking water. When showering in conditioned or softened water you will enjoy healthier skin and hair.

<p>In truth, that's how tough water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this sort of water leaves. In time these deposits can accumulate, clog, and even corrode pipes and cause major plumbing problems. Tough water deposits can build up in boilers and hot water heaters, making them less effective and more pricey to use Toilets have moving parts, and moving parts wear out or break.

Heating water represent approximately 20 percent of the average home's energy spending plan. Some gas-fired tankless water heaters claim to cut energy expenses by approximately half. But their included up-front expenses suggest it pays to look before you leap.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to determine the best water treatment for your house. Because the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space. The CareSoft ® system was established with the exact same innovative engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that delivers high-performance hardness elimination you can depend on for several years to come.</p>
