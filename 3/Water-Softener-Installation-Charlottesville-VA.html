<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Charlottesville VA</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
