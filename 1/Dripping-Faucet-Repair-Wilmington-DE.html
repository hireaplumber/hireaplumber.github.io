The city or Uruk contains the oldest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had replaceable and quickly removable sections, and enabled cleaning.</p>

<p>Often triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and inspect if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve might actuate intermittently, as well.

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
