They can determine the location of the blockage and the very best methods to unclog the bottleneck without damaging your plumbing.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
