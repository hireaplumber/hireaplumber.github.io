A standard manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
