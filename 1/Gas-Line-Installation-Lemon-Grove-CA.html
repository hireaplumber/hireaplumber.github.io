<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you may have heard sink disposals described as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're really appropriate, a sink waste disposal unit."

<p>Provided there isn't a tank failure, generally a commercial water heater can be fixed, but is it worth fixing? Only after answering the following concerns need to you respond to repair or replace.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
