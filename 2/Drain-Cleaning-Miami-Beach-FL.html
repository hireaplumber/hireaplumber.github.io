<p>Many softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the system.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
