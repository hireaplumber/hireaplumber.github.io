<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are particular contaminants that residents are dealing with and an RO can help alleviate those issues. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils which too can be fixed with the ideal RO system.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
