You can look at this by filling a couple of five-gallon containers with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you probably need a hot water heater replacement.</p>

So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Picture 1). Then get rid of the old manage and lever, slide the new deal with into place, and thread on the keeping nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
