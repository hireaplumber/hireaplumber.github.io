<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
