<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage ought to not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a safe and stable  location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing.
