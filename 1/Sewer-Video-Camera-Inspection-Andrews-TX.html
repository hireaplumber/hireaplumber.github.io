<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
