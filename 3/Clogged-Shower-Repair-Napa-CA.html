The brand-new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are removed to connect the pipes to the water components, Wood says. Depending upon the scope of work being performed and the kind of structure, you might have several inspections.</p>
