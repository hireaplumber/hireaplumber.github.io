The field test might not always reveal you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair package are required.

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair technician understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
