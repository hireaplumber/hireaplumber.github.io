Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system.

Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
