<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
