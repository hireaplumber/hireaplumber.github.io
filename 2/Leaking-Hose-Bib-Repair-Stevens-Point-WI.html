<p>Before the repair service technician begins the repair procedure, he must make sure he has assessed the work area around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any restrictive conditions. Correct security preventative measures must be followed for correct entry if the area is considered a restricted space. A proper and safe  work environment might entail the positioning of safety barriers or entry limitations around the work area so the repair service technician or the general public around your workspace are not damaged. This might impact the specialist's capability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a limiting area.</p>
