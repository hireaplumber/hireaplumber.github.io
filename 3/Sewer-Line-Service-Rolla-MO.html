<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Rolla MO</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
