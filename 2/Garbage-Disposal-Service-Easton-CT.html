<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
