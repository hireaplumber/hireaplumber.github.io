<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Whitesburg KY</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
