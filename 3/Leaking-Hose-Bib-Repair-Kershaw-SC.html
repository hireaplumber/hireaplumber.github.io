Adequate drainage should also be provided.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
