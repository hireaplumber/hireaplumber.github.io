<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
