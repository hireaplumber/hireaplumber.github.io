Blanc also built a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>

<p>If you have actually always lived in an area with difficult water, you might not recognize how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water.

If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>

Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>
