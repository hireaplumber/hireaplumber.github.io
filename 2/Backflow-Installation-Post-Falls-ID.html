<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
