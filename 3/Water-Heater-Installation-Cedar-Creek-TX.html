<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
