Old galvanized iron pipes may end up being corroded and add rust to the water system. Gurgling sound from pipes. An unusual, gurgling noise originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a great indication. Chances are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this concern. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
