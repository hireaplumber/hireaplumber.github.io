Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water system within a building these devices are called isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>

<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
