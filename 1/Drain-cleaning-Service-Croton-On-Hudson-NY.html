<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide.

If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
