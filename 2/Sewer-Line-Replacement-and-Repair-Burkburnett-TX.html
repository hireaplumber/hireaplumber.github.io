<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
