<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
