<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

Exemptions, which are granted in extremely rare cases where the building is deemed to not posture a threat to the supply of water, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner.

While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
