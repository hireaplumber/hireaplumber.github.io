For home, it is very important for owners to signal the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial residential or commercial property, the District evaluates making use of each new occupant. If the present backflow is not up to District code, the correction needs to be made before water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the tenant or the home owner.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard ways of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
