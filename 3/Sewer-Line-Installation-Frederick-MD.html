Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely formed bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a good concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or will not distribute your weight uniformly and might eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
