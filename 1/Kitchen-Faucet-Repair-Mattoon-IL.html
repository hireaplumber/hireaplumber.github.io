<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit.

Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it may require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation of water which might bring unclean water or other, dangerous substances into the public water system and personal plumbing. Backflow can occur in a number of scenarios that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outside water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
