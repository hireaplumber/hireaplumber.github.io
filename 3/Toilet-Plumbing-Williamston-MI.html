<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Williamston MI</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
