<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.

<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Coalinga CA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
