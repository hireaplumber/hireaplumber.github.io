Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated and offered for use. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's aspects can trigger the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of corrosion.</p>
