<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex clinical process, however simple to treat. It utilizes salt to eliminate minerals and smells found in difficult water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attract and connect sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
