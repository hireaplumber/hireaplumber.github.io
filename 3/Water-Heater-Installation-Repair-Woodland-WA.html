<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. The majority of folks replace their hot water heater due to poor efficiency, total failure or as a preventive procedure. It's time to think about replacing it with a more efficient model if your water heater is more than 10 years old. Water on the floor can imply used parts. Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole.
