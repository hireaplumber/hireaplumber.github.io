Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
