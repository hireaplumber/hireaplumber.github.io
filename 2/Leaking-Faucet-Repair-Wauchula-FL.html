<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.
