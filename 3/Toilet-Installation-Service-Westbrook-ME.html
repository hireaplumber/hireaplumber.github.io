<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Prior to salt begins operating in a water softener it requires a little residence time within the reservoir, considering that the salt is dissolving slowly.

It's time for a new one if your toilet obstructs more than once per week.</p>
