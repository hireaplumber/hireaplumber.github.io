<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
