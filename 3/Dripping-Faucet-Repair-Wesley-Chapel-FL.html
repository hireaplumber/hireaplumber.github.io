<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
