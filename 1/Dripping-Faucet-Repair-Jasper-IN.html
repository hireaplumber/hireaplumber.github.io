<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Jasper IN</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not position a threat to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
