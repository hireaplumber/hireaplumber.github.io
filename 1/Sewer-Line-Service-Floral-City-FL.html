<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide decades of defense. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water turbidity, temperature or quality can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might hardly ever need repair while some are fixed on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
