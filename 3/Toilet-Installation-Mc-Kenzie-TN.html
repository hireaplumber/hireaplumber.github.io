<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally directed somewhere else to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in.

In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographic areas with destructive water pollutants.</p>
