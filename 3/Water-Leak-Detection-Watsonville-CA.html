<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
