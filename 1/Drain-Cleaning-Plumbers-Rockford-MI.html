<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We identify what is incorrect with your water heater, along with what maintenance work requires to be carried out moving forward. Water softeners generally use salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from dissolved salt chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that look like wet sand.</p>
<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can take place with time from the buildup of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger with time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes appropriately. You can fight tough water in various ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
