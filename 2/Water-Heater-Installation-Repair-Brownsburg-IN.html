<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>A lot of softeners have a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet.

The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.
