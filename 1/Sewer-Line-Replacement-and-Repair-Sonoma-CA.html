<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Sonoma CA 95476</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
