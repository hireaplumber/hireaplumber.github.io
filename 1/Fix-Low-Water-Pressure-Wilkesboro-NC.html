<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened.
