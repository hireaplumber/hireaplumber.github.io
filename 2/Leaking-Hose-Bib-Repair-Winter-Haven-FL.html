<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
