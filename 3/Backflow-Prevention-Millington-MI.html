<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
