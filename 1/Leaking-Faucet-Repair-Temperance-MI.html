<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
