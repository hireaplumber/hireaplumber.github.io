<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the indicators of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
