<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
