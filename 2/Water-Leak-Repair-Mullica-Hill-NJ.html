<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
