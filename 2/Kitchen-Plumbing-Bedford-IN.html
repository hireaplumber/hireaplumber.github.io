<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
