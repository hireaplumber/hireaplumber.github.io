Storage tank water heaters are frequently discovered in most homes. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver warm water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
