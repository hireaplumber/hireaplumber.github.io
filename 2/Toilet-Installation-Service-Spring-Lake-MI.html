Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
