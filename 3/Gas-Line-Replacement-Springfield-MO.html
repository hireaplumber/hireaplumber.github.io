Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
