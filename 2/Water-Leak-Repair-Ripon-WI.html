<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>If you identify a drip, strategy to replace the water heater right away. Don't wait till the leak gets bad. A waste disposal unit provides a great convenience to your kitchen and minimize cleaning time.
