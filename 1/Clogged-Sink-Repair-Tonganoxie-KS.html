Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a risk to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
