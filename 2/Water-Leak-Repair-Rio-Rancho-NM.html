<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will establish. Sometimes the solution is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to fix the concern. Other times a more comprehensive option is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean.

<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
