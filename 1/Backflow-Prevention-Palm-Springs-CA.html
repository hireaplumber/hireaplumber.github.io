<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair.
