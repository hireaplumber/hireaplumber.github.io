<p>In reality, that's how difficult water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this type of water leaves. With time these deposits can collect, clog, and even corrode pipes and trigger significant plumbing problems.

If your toilet will not stop running, attempt repairing or changing these essential toilet parts.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
