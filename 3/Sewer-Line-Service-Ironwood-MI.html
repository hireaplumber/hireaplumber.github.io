<p>It is not always due to clogs that come from inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will identify the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces.

<p>Many house owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their clogged or dirty drain problems.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always suggested.</p>
