<p>It's at the end of its natural life and you're much better off getting a brand-new one if your hot water tank is over 15 years old.

At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction result and draw prospective impurities into the potable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are typically found in many houses. Their components are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to deliver warm water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
