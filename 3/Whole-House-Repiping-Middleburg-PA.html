<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less critical things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.
