<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Professional sewer inspections provide plumbers a detailed check out the pipeline at your residential or commercial property, allowing them to identify pipe function and condition. When you have a problem with your sewer line, you need a professional inspection to properly identify the problem.
