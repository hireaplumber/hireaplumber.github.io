When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through.

This triggers the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are accessible, leading to the weird noises originating from your sink.</p>

You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware shop. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the hardness out of water.</p>
