Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water.

Adequate drainage should also be offered.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.
