<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas.

As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking.
