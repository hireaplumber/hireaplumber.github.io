Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
