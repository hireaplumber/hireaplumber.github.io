<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
