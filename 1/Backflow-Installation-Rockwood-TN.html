<p>3. Solar Salt originates from vaporized seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs.

<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>If you have actually ever been frustrated by cloudy white areas on your dishes that won't go away, white t-shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a persistent layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll be happy to know that water softening can get rid of these problems and more. Hard water triggers these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to worry about any problems with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes tasks simpler and less annoying for everybody involved.</p>
