<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Howell MI 48843</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
