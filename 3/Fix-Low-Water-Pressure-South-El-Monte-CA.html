Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
