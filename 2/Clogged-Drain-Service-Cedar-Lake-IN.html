Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
