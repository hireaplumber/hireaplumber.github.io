<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
