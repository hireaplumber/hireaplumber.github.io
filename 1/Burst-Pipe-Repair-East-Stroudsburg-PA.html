<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
