<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
