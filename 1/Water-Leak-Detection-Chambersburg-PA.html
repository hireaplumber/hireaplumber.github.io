Which is why choosing a comfy, reliable toilet seat is incredibly important. However, you have to make sure your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been particularly designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or won't disperse your weight equally and might eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
