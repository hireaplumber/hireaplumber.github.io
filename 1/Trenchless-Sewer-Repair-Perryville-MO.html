<p>Backflow is a possible problem in a water supply due to the fact that it can spread infected water back through a distribution system. For example, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any real or potential connection in between the general public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow pollutants or contaminants to go into the potable water supply.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
