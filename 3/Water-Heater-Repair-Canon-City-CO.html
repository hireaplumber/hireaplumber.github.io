<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
