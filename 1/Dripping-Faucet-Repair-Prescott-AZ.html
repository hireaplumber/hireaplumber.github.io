Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part.

If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals described as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually correct, a sink waste disposal system."
