<p>The most efficient way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Drains clog for a reason, but it's not constantly apparent. It is strongly advised that a professional plumber carry out a camera inspection on a main sewer line after it has actually clogged. This is doubly essential if you're purchasing a home. Envision in the above situation understanding the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a house. You can't always be particular whether the home has had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous property owner understood the reason for the clog A simple camera inspection might make you knowledgeable about a very expensive and concealed problem prior to the purchase.</p>
