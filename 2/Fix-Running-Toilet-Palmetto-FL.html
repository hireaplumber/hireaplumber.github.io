<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more detergent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
