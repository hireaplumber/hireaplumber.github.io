<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
