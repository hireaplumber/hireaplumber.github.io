<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Encino CA 91316</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
