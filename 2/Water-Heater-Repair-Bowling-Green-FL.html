<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
