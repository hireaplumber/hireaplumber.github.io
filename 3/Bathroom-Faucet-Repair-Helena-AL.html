<p>As soon as the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position.

The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly.
