New meters need to satisfy regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers might need an unique meter for their services, limiting your choices. Layout - Once you add a second floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive.
