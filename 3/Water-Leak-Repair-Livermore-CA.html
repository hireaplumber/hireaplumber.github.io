<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Livermore CA</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it too.</p>

You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.
