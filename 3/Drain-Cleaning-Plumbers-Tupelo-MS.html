<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing annual forward flow tests are often perceived as a required to have them. But the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
