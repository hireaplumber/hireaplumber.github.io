<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Aliquippa PA</h3>

If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new unit in.
