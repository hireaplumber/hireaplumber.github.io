<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
