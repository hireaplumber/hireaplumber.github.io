<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
