<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've contacted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
