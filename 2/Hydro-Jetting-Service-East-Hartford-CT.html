<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank.
