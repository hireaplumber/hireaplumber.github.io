<p>The program accomplishes its objective by offering the adoption and promulgation of appropriate rules and regulations for the building of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a new hot water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it installed correctly.

It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position.

The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
