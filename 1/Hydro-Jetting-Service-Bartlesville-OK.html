They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
