<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
