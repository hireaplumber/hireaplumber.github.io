<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
