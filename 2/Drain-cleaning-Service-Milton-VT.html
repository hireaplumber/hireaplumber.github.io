<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
