<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
