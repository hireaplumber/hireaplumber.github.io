<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of keeping the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you discover odd popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating element. Running out of hot water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I've talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
