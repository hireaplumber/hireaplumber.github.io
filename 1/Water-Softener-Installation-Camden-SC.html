<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak.
