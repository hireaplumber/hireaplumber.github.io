<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
