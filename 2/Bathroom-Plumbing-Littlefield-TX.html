<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair.
