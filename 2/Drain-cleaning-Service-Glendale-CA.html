<p>Property owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is especially prudent to arrange inspections on a yearly basis and when buying a brand-new house.

<p>Your storm drains don't go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically directed somewhere else to a close-by treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in.
