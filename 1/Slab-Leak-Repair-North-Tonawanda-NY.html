<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>

A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the device. Each place where you will have a gas device should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle just, anyone who installs gas piping on home not under their ownership should have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License.
