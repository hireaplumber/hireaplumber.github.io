Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils and that too can be treated with the right RO system.</p>
