<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent efficiency of research, vacuum, and commercial process systems. Checking the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be severe issue. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house ought to have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working effectively, you are off to a good start.</p>

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
