<p>The very best method to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities site is by setting up a pressure minimizing valve (PRV). A PRV will manage water pressure as it enters into the house.

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
