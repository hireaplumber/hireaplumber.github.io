<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
