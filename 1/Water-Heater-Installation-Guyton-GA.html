Some homeowners will try to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, particularly if you are dealing with a little drain clog. However, they are generally temporary fixes that do not provide long-term resolutions.</p>
