<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components.

If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
