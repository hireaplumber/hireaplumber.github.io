<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to prevent off that hazard, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking.
