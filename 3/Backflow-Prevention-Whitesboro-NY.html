<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
