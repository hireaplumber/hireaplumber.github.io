<p>Once the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
