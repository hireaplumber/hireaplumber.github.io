<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complex issues with water temperature level or pressure may require changing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of years, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
