Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>

When preparing to connect another sewer into the line, a camera can also be utilized to aesthetically inspect the condition of a sewer line.
