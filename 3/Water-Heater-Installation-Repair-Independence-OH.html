<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Independence OH</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your home or organisation, and its ability to function is important.
