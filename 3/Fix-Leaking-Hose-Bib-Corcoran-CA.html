<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
