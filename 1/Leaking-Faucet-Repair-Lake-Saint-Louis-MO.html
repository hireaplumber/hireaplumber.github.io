<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for many building contractors (or their employees).

This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
