<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it also.</p>
