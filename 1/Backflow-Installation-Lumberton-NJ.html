Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
