Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
