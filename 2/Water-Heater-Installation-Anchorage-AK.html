<p>Many house owners believe their utility companies or property owners insurance is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the reality is that in most cases you, the homeowner, are accountable.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try discarding a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and after that turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, worn sink? No issue is undue for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing team finishes the job rapidly and affordably.</p>
