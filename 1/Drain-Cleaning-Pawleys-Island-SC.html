A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts break, they lead to tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>There are 2 broad classifications of sources of potential cross contamination: internal and external. Internal sources consist of the aforementioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning tasks, and devices such as meal washers, hot water tanks, glowing water heater, etc. External sources consist of rain water run-off from roofings and parking area, groundwater, puddles of surface water, hygienic sewer pipelines, other supply of water pipelines, sewage-disposal tanks, underground storage tanks and cisterns, watering pipelines and ditches, fish ponds, natural bodies of water, lawn sprinklers, agricultural run-off from animal lots, drainage from compost piles, buried or aboveground chemical storage tanks, gray water from water recycling systems, and backup of combined overflow sewers during heavy rainfall occasions into building foundations and basements.</p>
