<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
