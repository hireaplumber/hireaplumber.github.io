<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
