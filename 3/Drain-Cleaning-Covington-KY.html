High energy costs? It might be time for a brand-new hot water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up effectively. A hot water heater that is not installed correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, and even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of warm water is the biggest sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater.

<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
