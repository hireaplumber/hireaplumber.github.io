<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a possible issue with the water heater. It can also suggest the water heater is near completion of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old. With heavy deterioration accumulation on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could mean that there have actually been fluctuations in pressure causing small leakages.</p>

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
