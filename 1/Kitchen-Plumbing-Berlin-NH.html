<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
