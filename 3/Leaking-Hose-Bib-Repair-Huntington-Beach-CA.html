<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a waste disposal unit is just equipped to manage softer natural waste.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
