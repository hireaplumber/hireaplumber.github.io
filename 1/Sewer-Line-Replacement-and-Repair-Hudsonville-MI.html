<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the hardness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it concerns pipe repair, the most pricey factors aren't the equipment or materials used, but the yard, landscaping and uprooting damage that occurs.</p>
<p>Many property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their dirty or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are simple to use and inexpensive, but they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize extreme chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly suggested.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, specifically when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
