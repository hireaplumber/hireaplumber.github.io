<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself in Duncansville PA 16635</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
