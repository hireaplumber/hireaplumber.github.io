<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.
