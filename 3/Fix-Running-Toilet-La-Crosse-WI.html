<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are certain pollutants that locals are dealing with and an RO can help minimize those issues. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be corrected with the best RO system.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
