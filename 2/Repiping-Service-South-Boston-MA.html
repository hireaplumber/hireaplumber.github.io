<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
