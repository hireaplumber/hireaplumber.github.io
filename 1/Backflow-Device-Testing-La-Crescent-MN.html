Which is why choosing a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is exceptionally essential. However, you have to make certain your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight uniformly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
<p>This is very crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system.
