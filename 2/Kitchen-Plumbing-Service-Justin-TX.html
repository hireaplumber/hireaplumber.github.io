<h3>Plumbing Services Around Justin TX</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Was your house constructed before the 1970s and has not undergone improvement or pipe replacement? If so, it is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has worn away and rotted for many years. Older pipes can trigger significant leaks and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes will not last forever and will need to be replaced.</p>
