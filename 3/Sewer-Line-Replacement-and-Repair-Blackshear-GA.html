Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. Nevertheless, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange occur? There is another important component needed to make the procedure work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>

<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Blackshear GA</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water treated with a water softener system might not just conserve customers cash but might also be environmentally friendly, because it helps cut back on harmful cleaning agents going into water streams. In locations where there is extremely hard water, consumers can typically cut cleaning agent usage in dishwashers and washing machines by more than 50% after softening and get the same results.</p>
