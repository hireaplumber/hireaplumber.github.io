<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Ligonier IN</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
