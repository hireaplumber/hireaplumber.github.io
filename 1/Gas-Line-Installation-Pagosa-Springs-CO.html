<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed.

The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>
