<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>Though changing an existing waste disposal unit with a brand-new one is a fairly easy job, setting up a disposal where there wasn't one before requires both plumbing and electrical skills.
