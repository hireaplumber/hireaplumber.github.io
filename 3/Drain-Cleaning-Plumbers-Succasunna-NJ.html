Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually struggles with deterioration and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
