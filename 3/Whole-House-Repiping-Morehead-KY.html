<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>

Licensed professional plumbers will identify and repair the gas leak, provide licenses, and coordinate with the city for final inspections.
