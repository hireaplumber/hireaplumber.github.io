<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and scenarios that require backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is very important for owners to inform the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial property, the District evaluates the use of each new renter. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction should be made before water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the property or the tenant owner.</p>
