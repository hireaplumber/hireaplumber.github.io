<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
