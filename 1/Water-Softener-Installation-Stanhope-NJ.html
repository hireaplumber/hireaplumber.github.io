There are also lots of price points for brand-new faucets to fit every design and budget plan. The kind of new faucet you choose may be limited by the variety of pre-drilled holes in your existing bathroom or kitchen countertop. When faucet and sink problems need replacement, our plumbers have a large selection of faucet replacements right on their truck, generally getting rid of a follow-up service call and getting your plumbing issue solved on the spot.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
