<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is normally spotted before it triggers any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This little hole permits water to continually leak out very slowly. With time it can result in a substantial build of water. Leaked water typically stays under your home and fills into the ground soil. If the house's structure was not appropriately compressed, this can potentially trigger a cavity. This is an unusual event and in general, there is little issue over structural damage as the result of a slab leak.</p>
