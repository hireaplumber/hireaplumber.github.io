<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the significant offenders. They harden to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create major drain obstructions by twisting around pipes.

If this is what is taking place to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it results in further damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
