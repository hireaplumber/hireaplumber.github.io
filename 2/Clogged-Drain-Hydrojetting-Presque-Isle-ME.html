Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
