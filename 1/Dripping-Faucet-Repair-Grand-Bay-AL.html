We ask that you do not squander at any time attempting to determine the factor behind your plumbing problems, as this can further delay looking for the professional help you need.</p>
<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that chance.

Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
