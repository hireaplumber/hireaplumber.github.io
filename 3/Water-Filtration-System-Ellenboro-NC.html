<p>Supply of water by the water company consists of some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are essential requirements, not optional costs. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, done with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can result in a buildup of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable results on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>The sink is a main function of kitchens and bathrooms and are vulnerable to getting clogged drains. When this plumbing fixture is not running correctly, having a clogged sink or a leaking sink gets in the way of your household routine and causes a significant hassle. Sometimes you may need to replace your entire sink and our professionals are all set to help you with sink installation in addition to our sink repair services.</p>
