Some property owners will try to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These remedies do work, especially if you are dealing with a small drain clog. Nevertheless, they are normally short-term repairs that do not offer permanent resolutions.</p>
