<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working effectively because difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use a growing number of detergent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated during regeneration. Lastly, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
