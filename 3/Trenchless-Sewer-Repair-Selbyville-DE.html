<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Rusting and rust on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a possible problem with the water heater. It can also imply the water heater is near completion of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old.
