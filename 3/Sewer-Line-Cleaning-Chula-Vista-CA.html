It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
