<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in Collins Mississippi</h2>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Keeping your garbage dispoal clean isn't really challenging or time consuming. Fill the sink at least half filled with soapy water.
