Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
