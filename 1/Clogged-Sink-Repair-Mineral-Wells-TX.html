Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>On its own, gas is colorless and odorless. Many utility companies add a sulfur compound to gas, which is where the rotten egg odor comes from. That method, you can quickly inform if you have a gas leak.
