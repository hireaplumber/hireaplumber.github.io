<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for a lot of fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
