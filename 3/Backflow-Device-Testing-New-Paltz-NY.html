<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, a lot of drain issues can only be detected once they begin to back up. However, during routing plumbing inspections, a complete test of all drains will be performed. If something might be occurring behind the walls or in the ground, plumbers can try to recreate problems to figure out. Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is a lot more effective at removing clogs. Lots of houses have drain cleanouts, however, we experience older houses without cleanouts. If you are having drain problems, a professional plumber can add cleanouts to your house.</p>
