As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
