<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a tough task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
