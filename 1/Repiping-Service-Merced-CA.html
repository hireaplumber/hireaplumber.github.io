<p>When the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
