<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to locate and end up easy repairs, so include that in the cost when choosing to deal with the problem by yourself.

<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in joists, floors, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
