<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable.

<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system.

<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Annapolis MD</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
