<p>The normal service is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water.
