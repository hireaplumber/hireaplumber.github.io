<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Many common single household house systems will not require supply piping bigger than 3‚ÅÑ4 inch (19 mm) due to cost as well as steel piping's propensity to become blocked from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe gradually once the internal galvanizing zinc covering has broken down. In drinkable water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographical locations with destructive water contaminants.</p>
