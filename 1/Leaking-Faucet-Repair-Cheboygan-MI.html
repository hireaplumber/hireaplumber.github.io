The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
<p>The most common technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another aspect, usually salt. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes just a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered really low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
