<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a changing water utilize schedule.</p>
