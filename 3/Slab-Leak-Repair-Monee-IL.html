<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

By calling Bell Cow at (844) 234-2355 upon very first observing an issue, you can prevent more serious problems brought on by leaks, like structural damage.
