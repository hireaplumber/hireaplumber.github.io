<p>Gas leaks are typically discovered at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that allows connections and disconnections of gas home appliances. A quick method to detect a gas leak is if you use liquid dish soap to the suspected area. If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and should instantly contact a gas plumber to perform an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to take a look at. You may need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is fairly new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing companies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
