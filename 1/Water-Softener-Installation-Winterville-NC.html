<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Winterville NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
