<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
