<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
