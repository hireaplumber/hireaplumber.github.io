After the process is complete, you end up with soft water that has sodium in it however no other minerals.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent style of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or fixed circulation condition may cause nuisance leaking and potential fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>

Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not appropriately protected, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
