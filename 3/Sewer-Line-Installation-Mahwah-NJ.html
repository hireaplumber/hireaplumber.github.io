<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
