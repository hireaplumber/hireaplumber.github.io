<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are eliminated to connect the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood says. Depending on the scope of work being performed and the kind of building, you might have several inspections.</p>
