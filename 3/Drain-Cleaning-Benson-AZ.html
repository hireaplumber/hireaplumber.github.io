<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream might cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal system will need can vary depending on how often it's used, its age, and the type of items you're putting in it.
