<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices.
