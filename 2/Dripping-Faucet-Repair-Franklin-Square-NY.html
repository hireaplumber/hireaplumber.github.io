<p>As a locally-owned business, stability and duty are exceptionally crucial to building a credibility for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean water system within a building these gadgets are known as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
