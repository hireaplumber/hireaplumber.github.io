<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for most construction contractors (or their employees). The key to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers readily available that you might run into. The first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Check although it may be marketed as one! Don't get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>
