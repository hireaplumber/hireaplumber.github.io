It might be normal to have condensation on hot water pipes, but it's absolutely not typical for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
