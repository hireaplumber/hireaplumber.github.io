<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
