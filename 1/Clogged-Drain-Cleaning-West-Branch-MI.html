<p>Whether a supply of water is identified "soft" or "tough" depends on the existence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no negative effects and are, in fact, essential daily nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the revitalizing taste lots of people discover desirable.

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high threat defense assembly.</p>
