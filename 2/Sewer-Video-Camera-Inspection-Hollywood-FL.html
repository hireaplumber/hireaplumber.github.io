<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange happen? There is one other important element needed to make the process work: a resin bed including great deals of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>

When showering in conditioned or softened water you will delight in much healthier skin and hair.

<p>It can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less quickly when water is hard. Water softening can prevent these unfavorable results. Natural gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides gas an odor typically related to rotten eggs. This distinct fragrance allows you to smell a potential leak if it occurs. If you suspect a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Domestic water that arrives to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and parts. To avoid deterioration from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting damaging products.
