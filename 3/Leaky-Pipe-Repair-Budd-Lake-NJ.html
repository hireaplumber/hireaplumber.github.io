<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
