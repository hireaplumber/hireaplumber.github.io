Water pressure might be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house.
