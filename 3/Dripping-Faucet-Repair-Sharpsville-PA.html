<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
