<p>Your storm drains don't go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically carried elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in.

<p>Having your plumbing routinely evaluated is an essential component of preventative maintenance. However, many house owners and business owners have an out of sight, out of mind" approach to plumbing and do not assess their pipes until there is a pushing issue.

<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>You need to spend a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a resilient finish mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to use but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
