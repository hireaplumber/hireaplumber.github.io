Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
