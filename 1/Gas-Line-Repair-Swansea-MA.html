<p>Our group at All Phase Plumbing also uses drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a exceptional and long lasting  choice for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. It is pressed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and fractures. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in place for several hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the process is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
