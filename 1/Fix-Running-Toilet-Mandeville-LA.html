<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a range of reasons, including poor soil conditions, blockages from grease and grime, and corrosion.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
