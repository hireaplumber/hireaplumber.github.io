<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Hampton GA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not position a threat to the supply of water, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
