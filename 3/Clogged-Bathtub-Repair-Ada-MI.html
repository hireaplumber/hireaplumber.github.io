The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
