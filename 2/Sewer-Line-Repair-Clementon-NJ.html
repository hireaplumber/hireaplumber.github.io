Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
