<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Gustine CA 95322</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
