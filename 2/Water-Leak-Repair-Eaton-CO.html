<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
