<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems.

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral material, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
