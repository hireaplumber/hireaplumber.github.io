Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a great concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
