So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to think about. A totally various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into location. A protected seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to connect wires properly, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
