Your plumbing inspector will inform you if they're needed.</p>
<p>Some house owners may think of water softeners as a luxury product, something that's great to have" but not entirely essential. Nevertheless, difficult water can trigger everything from minor inconveniences, like areas on dishes or soap scum, to significant problems like a much shorter life-span for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other vital home appliances.

<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
