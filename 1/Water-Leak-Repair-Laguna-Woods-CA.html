<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. However discovering the best washer might not be. The most common washers are typically offered in your home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to find. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
