<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
