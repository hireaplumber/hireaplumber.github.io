<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old.

This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then return to service.
