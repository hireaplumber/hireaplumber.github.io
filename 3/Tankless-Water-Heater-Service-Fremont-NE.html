<p>Inside the house, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leaks or drips. Inspect beneath sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber estimated rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I checked around. Under the sink, position a pail or pan underneath the waste pipe, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
