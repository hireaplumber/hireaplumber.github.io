Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be offered.</p>
