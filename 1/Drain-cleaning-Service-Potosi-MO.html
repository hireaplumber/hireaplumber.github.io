To avoid the headache of clogged drains, overruning toilets, and backed-up sewer lines, it is essential to have regular, preventative maintenance carried out by a qualified Chicago sewer and drain professional.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company supplies include check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and lowered pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, get rid of the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to installing the disposal. Likewise connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>
