<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to think of.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.
