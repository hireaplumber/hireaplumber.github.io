<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your house or service, and its ability to function is vital.

As rust and minerals build up with time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>
