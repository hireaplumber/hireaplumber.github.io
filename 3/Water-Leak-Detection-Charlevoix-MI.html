<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to bond or spot a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to conserve cash. While this may work in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the same material as other pipes in your home, meaning that trouble might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and avoid larger leakages down the roadway.</p>
