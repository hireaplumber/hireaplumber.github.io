<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
