<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low.

Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
