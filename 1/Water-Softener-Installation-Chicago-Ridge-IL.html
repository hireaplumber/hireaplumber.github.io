<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
