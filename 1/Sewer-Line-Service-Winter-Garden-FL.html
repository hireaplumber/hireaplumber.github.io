<p>If you need a water softener is a personal choice, identifying. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
