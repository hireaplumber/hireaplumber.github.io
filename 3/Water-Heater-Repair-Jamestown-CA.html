It's also helpful since, at the very same time, the plumber can anticipate the drains and suggest any drain repair, or drain cleaning company. In some cases whatever is clogging the drain won't budge. If you have actually attempted to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink without any luck, it might be time to call a professional plumber.
