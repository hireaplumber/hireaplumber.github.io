<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Middletown NY</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or numerous gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally unusual cases where the building is considered to not pose a danger to the water supply, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
