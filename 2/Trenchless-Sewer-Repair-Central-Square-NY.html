<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each component.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
