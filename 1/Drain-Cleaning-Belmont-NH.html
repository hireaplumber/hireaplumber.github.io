<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
