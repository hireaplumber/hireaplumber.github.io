Water pressure might stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
