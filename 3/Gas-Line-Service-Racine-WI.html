Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is advisable. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is suggested by its Energy Factor (EF). The more efficient the hot water heater the greater the EF rating. Nevertheless, just because a water heater has a higher EF worth, it does not always suggest it will have lower operating costs. You also have to think about the fuel source.</p>
