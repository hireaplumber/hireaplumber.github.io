<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Shavertown PA</h3>

I chose this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it too.</p>
