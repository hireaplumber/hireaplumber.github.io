<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than items including extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
