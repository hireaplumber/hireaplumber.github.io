<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>You have to invest at least $50 to get a premium kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient finish and a reliable stopper system. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be bothersome. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to use however needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
