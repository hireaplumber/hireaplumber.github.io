<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it could wreak undesirable problems on your property. .

Most fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism.
