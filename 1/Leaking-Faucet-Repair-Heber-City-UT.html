<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
