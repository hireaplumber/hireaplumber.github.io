<p>You reside in an older home. There's a good opportunity that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
