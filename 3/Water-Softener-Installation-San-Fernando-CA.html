<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation package includes a tube, or buy one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>
