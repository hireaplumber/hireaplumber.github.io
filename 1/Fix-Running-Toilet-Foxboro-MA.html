<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Foxboro MA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in extremely unusual cases where the structure is considered to not pose a threat to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
