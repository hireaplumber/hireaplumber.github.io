<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs.

Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating supplies a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can result in a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger substantial problems and damage-- especially common in older homes. Using a sewer camera to examine the weak locations or clog, our highly trained experts can rapidly find the source of the problem keeping your sewer line from doing its task-- efficiently carrying wastewater to your septic tank or municipal system.</p>
