<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing business. When shopping for a brand-new flapper, your best alternative is to attempt and find the exact same flapper that originally came with your existing flush valve. The most convenient method to do that is by looking up your toilet design and choosing the flapper recommended for that model. If you don't understand your model number, nevertheless, we do provide an extensive choice of "will fit" flappers to help you out. Watch the video listed below for more information about the various type of flappers offered, or visit How To Replace Toilet Flappers for quick tutorials on changing toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>

<p>The good news is that it doesn't always require a repair of your entire unit if you believe your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain service technician to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify problem. This type of camera is specifically helpful in locating a problem if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system.</p>
