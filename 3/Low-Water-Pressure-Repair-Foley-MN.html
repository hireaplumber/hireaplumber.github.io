<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
