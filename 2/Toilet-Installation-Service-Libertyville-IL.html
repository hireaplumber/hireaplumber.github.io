Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
