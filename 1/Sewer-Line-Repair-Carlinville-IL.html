<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas.

Nevertheless, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make certain to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
