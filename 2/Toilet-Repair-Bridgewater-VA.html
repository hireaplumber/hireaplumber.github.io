It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
