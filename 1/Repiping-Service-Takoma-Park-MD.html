<p>Property owners often ask if a gas water heater or an electrical system is more cost-efficient. The answer depends upon your home. While gas models are more economical to operate, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical water heater is typically lower, but it can be more expensive to run. Electric varieties are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>

This roof plumbing inspection checklist was created to assess roofs, rain gutters, and downpipe traps if clear and unblocked.
