There are various concerns that result in leaking or dripping faucets, such as damaged -rings, worn washers, destroyed valve seats, and more.

<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation.
