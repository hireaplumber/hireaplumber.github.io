Numerous scattering systems already have the proper backflow preventer installed and need only be evaluated yearly. Others might not fulfill state and local regulations and may need to be replaced with the appropriate backflow preventer.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently comparable, though replacement usually will not require added fees, such as application costs. New meters need to meet regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas companies might need a special meter for their services, limiting your choices.
