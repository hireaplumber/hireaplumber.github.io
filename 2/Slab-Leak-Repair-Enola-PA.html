<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Company in Enola</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>

<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
