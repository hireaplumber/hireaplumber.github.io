<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Landrum SC</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
