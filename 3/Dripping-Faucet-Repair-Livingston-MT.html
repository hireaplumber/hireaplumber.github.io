<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents impurities or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water supply. Lots of scattering systems already have the correct backflow preventer set up and need only be tested each year. Others may not fulfill state and local regulations and might need to be replaced with the appropriate backflow preventer.</p>
<p>One common method for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread tremendously if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from receding out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
