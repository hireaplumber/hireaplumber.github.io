<p>If your assembly stops working the yearly test, you are responsible for changing the assembly or repairing within one month. All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct kind of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see area listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly should fulfill the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be stopped till the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when used in fighting a fire. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about safeguarding people's lives and to a lower degree their property.

This can develop cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome imply that the level of defense on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high hazard protection level.</p>
