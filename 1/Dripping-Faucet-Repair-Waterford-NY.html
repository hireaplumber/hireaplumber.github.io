You need to wait till after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You need to also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
