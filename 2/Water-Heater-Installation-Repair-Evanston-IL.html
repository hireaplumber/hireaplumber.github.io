<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
