Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly safeguarded, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing annual forward flow tests are in some cases perceived as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
