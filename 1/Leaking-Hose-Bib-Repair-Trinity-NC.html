<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Typically, the savings have actually been based largely on minimizing chemical and cleaning agent costs. While those cost savings are still substantial, brand-new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) likewise uses significant water and salt savings.</p>
