<p>It can take numerous weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be set up must be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may take up to three weeks or more to process and authorize. Rejected plans should be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can include another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
