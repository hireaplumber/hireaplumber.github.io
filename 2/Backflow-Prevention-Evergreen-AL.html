Action 6: If there are no leakages, or when any leaks have been corrected, the drywall is changed. Trenching costs in between $4 and $12 per linear foot depending upon the depth. The provider must get a license prior to trenching. How often a backflow preventer needs to be checked depends upon its type. There are two main type of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and decreased pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most typically used in commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Galvanized steel potable water supply and distribution pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly costly, and hard to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements normally found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications. It is also incredibly resilient and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely utilized pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
