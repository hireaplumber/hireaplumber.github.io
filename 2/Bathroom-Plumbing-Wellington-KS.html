<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions guarantee the safety, security and consistent efficiency of research, vacuum, and commercial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure includes finishing Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leakages and corrosion within the line.
