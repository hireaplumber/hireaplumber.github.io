A toilet's tank is composed of numerous little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
