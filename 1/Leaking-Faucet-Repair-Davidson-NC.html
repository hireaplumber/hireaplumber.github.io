<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>It's a good concept to weigh the pros and cons of this innovative option if you're thinking about changing to a tankless water heater. While tankless water heaters are excellent in many aspects, they are not perfect for everyone. For example, households with a lot of relative or roommates, as well as those that require more than average quantities of hot water daily, will most likely benefit more from a traditional tank water heater.</p>
