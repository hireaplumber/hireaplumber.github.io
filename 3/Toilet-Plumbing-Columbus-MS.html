DO use lots of water each time you grind up food residue, and keep water running for a couple of seconds after the disposal is done. When you're ready to in fact install your garbage disposal, follow these steps listed below courtesy of Lowe's job professional, Hunter Macfarlane. As you go through these steps, if anything gives you pause, do not hesitate to contact a pro. There's no embarassment in getting a little help when you need it.</p>
<p>With time, like any other home appliance in your house, your garbage disposal. may require repairs. A disposal system may clog or begin to leak through heavy, or incorrect, usage. A leak somewhere in the system may show a worn seal. In some cases, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the entire system. This is where the UPC really enters play.

<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last permanently. It has been in location because your house was constructed so it has to do with the exact same age as your home. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and rust. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your home.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
