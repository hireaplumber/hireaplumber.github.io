<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are among the most common plumbing concerns plumbers deal with, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is prepared to overflow. You can try to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware store. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the solidity out of water.</p>
