<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
