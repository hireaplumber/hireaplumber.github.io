<p>The majority of common single family home systems won't require supply piping larger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to expenditure along with steel piping's tendency to end up being blocked from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe with time once the internal galvanizing zinc covering has actually broken down. In potable water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographical locations with destructive water contaminants.</p>

But their added up-front costs suggest it pays to look before you leap.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank.

Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
