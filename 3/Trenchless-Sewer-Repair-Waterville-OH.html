I picked this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
