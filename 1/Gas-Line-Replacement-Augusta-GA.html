<p>Having a plumbing company on hand that you can call is vital due to the fact that you have to move quickly in the face of a gas leak. Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating has technicians extensively trained to find the area of the leak, and either repair or replace the pipe, depending on the seriousness of the leak. Before working with any pro, make sure to request free estimates on how much it will cost to fix your plumbing problems. While you certainly want to get your kitchen faucet up and running once again (you have actually got dishes to do! Family to feed!), you don't wish to overpay or be captured with an unanticipated cost.</p>
<p>Strainers are advised prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire fighting water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
