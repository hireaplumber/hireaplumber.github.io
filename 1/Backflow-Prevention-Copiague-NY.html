<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "hard" depends on the existence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable effects and are, in fact, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that give water the refreshing flavor many individuals find preferable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>

<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Copiague NY</h3>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten as essential. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cords as wanted.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a residence is due to the fact that there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite inexpensive and simple to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease solidifies it stays with the pipe and prevents water circulation, eventually causing a backup. This added with other particles in your drain can trigger a significant backup.</p>
