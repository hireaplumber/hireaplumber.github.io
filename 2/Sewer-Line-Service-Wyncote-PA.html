<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller design that operated on the very same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
