<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
