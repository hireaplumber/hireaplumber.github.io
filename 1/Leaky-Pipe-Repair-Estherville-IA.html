When tree roots start to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are significantly harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it.
