<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>This is exceptionally important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system.
