During regrowth, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>

Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>

<p>Examine the home's warm water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age.
