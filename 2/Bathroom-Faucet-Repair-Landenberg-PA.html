<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Pipeline video inspection is a kind of telepresence utilized to visually examine the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A common application is for a plumber to determine the condition of little size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification.

<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller model that ran on the same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and municipal sewer pipes.

<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing offered outstanding service for us in changing an extremely balky tub spout, and worn toilet parts.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
