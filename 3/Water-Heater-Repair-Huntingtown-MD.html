<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
