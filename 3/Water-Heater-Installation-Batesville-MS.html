<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with hard water, you might not understand how much it impacts you-- however if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Hard water interferes with the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp.

Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
