Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
