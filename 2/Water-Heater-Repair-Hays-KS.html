For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly.

If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst.
