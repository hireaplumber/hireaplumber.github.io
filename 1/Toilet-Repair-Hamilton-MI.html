<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
