<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, changing a gas or electric water tank with a comparable model takes two to three hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and eliminate your old water heater.

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
