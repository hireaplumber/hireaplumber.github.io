<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
