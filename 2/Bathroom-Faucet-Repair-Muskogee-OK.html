<p>These branching circulation pipelines form loops and networks consisting of water pipe and supply pipelines. Water mains vary in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in size. The pipelines offer water for whole communities in addition to large commercial, industrial and residential complexes. Depending on the flow capacity, location and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of materials: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter enhanced concrete.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
