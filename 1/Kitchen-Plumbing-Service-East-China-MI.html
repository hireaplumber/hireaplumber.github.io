<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up during building of a new or remodelled building is set up by knowledgeable artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Obstructions in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
