<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant factor to the hardness of Woodbury's water.
