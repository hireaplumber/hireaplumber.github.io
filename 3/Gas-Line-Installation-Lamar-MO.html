Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
