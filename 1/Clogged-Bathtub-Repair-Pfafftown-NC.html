<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or temporary connection in between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the significant culprits. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls too. Even tree roots can produce severe drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the problem for typical house plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned up before it causes more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
