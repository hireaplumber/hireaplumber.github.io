<p>Discussing whether to repair or replace your water heater? Our specialists will offer you a truthful recommendation. In basic, older hot water heater (over 8-10 years) experiencing repeating problems are much better off being changed. A more recent, more efficient water heater will conserve you in repair expenses and energy over time. Old-fashioned water softeners are notorious for causing a spike in the cost of your month-to-month utility expenses. Many need big quantities of water and can be expensive for the electrical power bill, however the NuvoH2O system is different. Our saltless WATER conditioning system consumes to 4x less water than others and needs no electrical energy.</p>
<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the unit). Each cycle will release 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of hardness minerals and chloride that you may not want just running outside. Not to point out plumbing code may be broken without proper backflow prevention.</p>
