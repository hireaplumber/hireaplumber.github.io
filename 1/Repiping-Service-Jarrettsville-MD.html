<p>A kitchen sink repair is a typical problem in most residential homes. It is one of the most used plumbing fixture that with time if not taken care of could trigger a big problem at the owners expense. As seen on the above image, there are many parts to a kitchen sink.

This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
