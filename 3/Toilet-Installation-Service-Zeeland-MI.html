Sediment Accumulation: If you notice odd popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be an indicator that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat.
