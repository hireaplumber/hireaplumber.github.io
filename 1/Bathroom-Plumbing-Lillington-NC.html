Blanc also constructed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable.

<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal proof that certain magnetic and electromagnetic gadgets can be effective in preventing scale development in tough water supply. It is extremely tough to judge such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well adequate explained to permit others to assess them and to verify the results. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it must make one hesitate to accept it without some assurance of performance.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection in between a public water supply or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
