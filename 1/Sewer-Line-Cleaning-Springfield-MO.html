<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>
