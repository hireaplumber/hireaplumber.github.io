<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>
