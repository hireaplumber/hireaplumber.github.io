This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly.

<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
