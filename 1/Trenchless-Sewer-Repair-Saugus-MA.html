<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Saugus MA</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these negative results. Gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas an odor often connected with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinctive scent permits you to smell a potential leak. Constantly leave if you think a leak.</p>
<p>You have actually got an issue with over-running or leaking if the sound of your toilet constantly running is typical to you. This water is being disposed down the overflow tube squandering as much as 200 gallons of water per day. That takes a toll on your water expense, not to point out the risk of a more major leak that could ruin your house with flooding.</p>
