<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
