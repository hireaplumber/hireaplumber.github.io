Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
