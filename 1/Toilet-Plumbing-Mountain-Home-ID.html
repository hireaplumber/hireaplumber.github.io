<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are seriously damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it.

<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more.
