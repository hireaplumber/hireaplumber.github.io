It is necessary that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
