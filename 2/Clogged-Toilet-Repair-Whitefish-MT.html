<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals expect to see but seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
