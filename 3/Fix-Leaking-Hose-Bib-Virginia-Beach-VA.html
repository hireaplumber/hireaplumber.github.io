<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Contractor in Virginia Beach</h2>

<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging job because of the age of your house and location of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
