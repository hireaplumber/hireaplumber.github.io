<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
