<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "tough" is dependent on the presence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no negative results and are, in truth, vital everyday nutrients.

However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the effectiveness of detergents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be difficult.</p>
