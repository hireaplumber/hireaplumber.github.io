<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>An electrical inspection offers inspection services for all commercial and commercial buildings, and verifies compliance with the electrical code.
