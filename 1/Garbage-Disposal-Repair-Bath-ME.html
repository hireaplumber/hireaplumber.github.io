<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls also. Even tree roots can create severe drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the problem for typical home plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned up prior to it causes more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
