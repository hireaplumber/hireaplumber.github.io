<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main water supply system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
