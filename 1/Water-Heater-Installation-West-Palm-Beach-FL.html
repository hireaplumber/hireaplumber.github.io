<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
