It is hardly ever used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and challenging to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements usually found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

Our repair procedures depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste buildup can avoid the liner from adhering to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all instructions to enable the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
