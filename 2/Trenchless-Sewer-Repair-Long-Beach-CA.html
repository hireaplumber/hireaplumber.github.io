<p>It prevails for hot water heater to leak due to fluctuating pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve becomes part of the unit for that specific factor. However while small drips must not be cause for concern, property owners should keep an eye on the hot water heater leaks. I had a great experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we required a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was professional and friendly. He also got the job done faster than initial estimated, so the work was more economical than I expected. I will use Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
