<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>All faucets and valves in your house need to be routinely exercised to keep them from freezing in location. For example, a single manage shower valve might become mineralized and calcified causing it to not work correctly when hired. Just like you and me, routine exercise keeps our bodies operating at a higher level than if we sat not doing anything every day.

An ounce of prevention can suggest the distinction in between having a working shower valve in the spare bathroom when visitors arrive or having to call a plumber.</p>
