<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
