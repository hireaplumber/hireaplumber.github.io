<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant contributor to the solidity of Woodbury's water. Firmness can look like a nuisance when water is boiled or dried from a drip due to the fact that it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes.

<p>Gas line leaks are a severe safety issue. Do not take any chances. Make sure the softener is set to the solidity of your supply of water. If the firmness is set expensive, the softener will cost more to operate and lose water, costing you additional money. Our plumbers have the proficiency and qualifications to deal with any plumbing repair or installation quickly and safely.</p>
