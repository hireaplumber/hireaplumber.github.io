Only a licensed plumber can carry out test and installation of brand-new gas lines.</p>
<p>While not every state needs insurance prior to contractor licenses are released, having your own warranties the security of your service. Unpredicted events and undesirable scenarios may take place anytime and being unprepared can put your service in big financial problem.

<p>A leak in a single pipe can easily be repaired by changing that area of damaged piping.
