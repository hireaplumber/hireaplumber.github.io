<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>
