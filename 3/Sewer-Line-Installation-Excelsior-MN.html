<h3>Broken Pipe in Excelsior Minnesota</h2>
<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
