<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was very pleased with their service.</p>
