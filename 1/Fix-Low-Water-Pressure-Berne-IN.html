<h3>Water Softeners & Filters in Berne Indiana</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
