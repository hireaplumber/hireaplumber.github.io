<p>When utilized in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about safeguarding individuals's lives and to a lesser extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source offered to attain that objective. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as a result suggest that the level of security on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high threat protection level.</p>
