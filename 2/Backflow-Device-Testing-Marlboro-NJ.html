The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.

When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
