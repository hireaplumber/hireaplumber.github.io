<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
