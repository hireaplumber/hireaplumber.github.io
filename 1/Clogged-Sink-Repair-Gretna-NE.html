<p>I can't state enough advantages about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a very brief amount of time due to closing on a house sale. Every single individual I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work team. Friendly, interacted well, absolutely responsive and truly cared to assist me through this extremely difficult job. All of the people I encountered were good example for what a well run service company ought to be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're great.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
