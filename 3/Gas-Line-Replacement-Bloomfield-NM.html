Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
