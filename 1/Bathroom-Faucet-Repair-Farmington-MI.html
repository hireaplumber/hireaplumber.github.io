<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
