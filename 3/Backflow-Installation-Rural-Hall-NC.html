<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
