It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water.

It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
