<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese.

The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
