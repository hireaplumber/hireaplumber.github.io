<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly.
