<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the existence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable effects and are, in reality, important daily nutrients. It is minerals that give water the refreshing flavor many individuals find preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they accumulation on contact surface areas, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>
