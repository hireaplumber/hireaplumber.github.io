<p>The very best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by setting up a pressure decreasing valve (PRV). A PRV will control water pressure as it enters the house. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can likewise help to conserve water as components in the home will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>

Leaked water usually remains under the house and saturates into the ground soil. This can possibly trigger a cavity if the house's foundation was not correctly compacted.
