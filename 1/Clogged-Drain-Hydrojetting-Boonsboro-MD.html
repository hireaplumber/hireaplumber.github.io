<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk security assembly.</p>
