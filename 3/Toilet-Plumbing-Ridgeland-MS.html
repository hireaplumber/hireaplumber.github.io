<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
