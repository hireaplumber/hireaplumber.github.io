<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services West Linn OR</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
