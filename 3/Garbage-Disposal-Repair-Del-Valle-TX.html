<p>Drain cleaning is an effective way to remove any clogs, or particles that have actually built up in your plumbing system.

If they're needed, your plumbing inspector will inform you.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to examine. If your toilet is fairly brand-new, you might need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain.

Examine the list of state licensing firms to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
