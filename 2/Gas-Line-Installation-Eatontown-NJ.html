<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe due to the fact that the plumber will need to browse through walls to do the job. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a huge job - and it's a job you want to get right. However the series of plumbing pipe products to pick from can make it confusing.

You need your drain cleaned before it leads to additional damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is taking place to your home.</p>
