<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building.
