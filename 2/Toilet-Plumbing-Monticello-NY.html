<p>It is not constantly due to clogs that originate inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will figure out the level of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>It's hard to determine if you have split or broken drains up until a video inspection is carried out.

ZOOM DRAIN carries out a complimentary peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
