<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
