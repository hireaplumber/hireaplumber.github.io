The pipelines offer water for whole neighborhoods along with big commercial, industrial and residential complexes. Depending on the circulation capability, location and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a variety of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter enhanced concrete.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an abrupt decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire battling or when a water pipe breaks.

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in an option and is used to reveal the strength of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will possibly add to the formation of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more corrosive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
