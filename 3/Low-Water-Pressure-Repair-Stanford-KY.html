<h3>Water Heater Service in Stanford Kentucky</h2>
<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
