It actually isn't an excellent concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight uniformly and might ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
