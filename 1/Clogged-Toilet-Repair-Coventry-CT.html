<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller model that operated on the same principle however might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains.

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
