<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
