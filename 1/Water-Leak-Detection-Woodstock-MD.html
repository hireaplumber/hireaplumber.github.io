This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking.
