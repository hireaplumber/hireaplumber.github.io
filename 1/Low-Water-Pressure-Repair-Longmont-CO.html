<p>A. If you have rust areas, utilizing phosphoric acid generally will help remove them. If you would like to attempt the gentlest method perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that doesn't suffice then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to check out the directions and security cautions first!).
