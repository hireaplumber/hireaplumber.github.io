<h3>Hydro Scrub Jetting in Durham Connecticut</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>

Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Are your plumbing pipes starting to reveal indications of wear? We can repipe your entire pipe system, or repair particular sections in your home or office the very same day.
