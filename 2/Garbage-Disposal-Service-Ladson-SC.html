<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank.

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
