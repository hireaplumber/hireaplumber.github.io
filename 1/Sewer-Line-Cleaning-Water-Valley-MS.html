<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can develop severe drain obstructions by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is occurring to your home.</p>
