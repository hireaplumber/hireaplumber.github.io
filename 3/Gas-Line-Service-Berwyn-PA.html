<p>Aside from these 2 essential parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
