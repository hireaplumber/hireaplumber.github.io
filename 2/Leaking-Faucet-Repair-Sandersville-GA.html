<p>While repairing your water heater is typically the less costly choice to make, it isn't always the ideal one depending upon your situation. When you employ Kramer and Sons to deal with your hot water heater, our skilled service technicians will review the pros and cons of replacement vs repair. However, there's still some research study you can do prior to we get here to assist accelerate the procedure.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately end up being worn out and need to be changed.

A professional plumber will be able to accurately locate the source of the leak and recommend the best option.
