<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away.

The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
