<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will establish.

<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers available that you might run into. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check despite the fact that it might be marketed as one! Don't get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>
