<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Though it's not always essential, often the plumber might need to update or repair electrical wiring to power the brand-new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot light may need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is damaged, the flowers or greenery near the gas leak will be discolored or weakened. Contact our experts to determine the level of the problem.</p>
