<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
