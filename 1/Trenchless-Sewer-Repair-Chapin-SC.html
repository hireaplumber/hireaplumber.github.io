<p>Galvanized metal, is just an easier way of saying zinc covered" and what causes galvanized pipes to wear away is the direct exposure to excessive water and minerals. You may be thinking that it does not make good sense to utilize a pipe that reacts with water as your home's main source of water transportation, and you would be right.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
