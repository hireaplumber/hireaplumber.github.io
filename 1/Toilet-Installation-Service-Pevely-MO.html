<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
