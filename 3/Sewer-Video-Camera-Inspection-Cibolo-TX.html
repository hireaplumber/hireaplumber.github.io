<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing set up during building and construction of a brand-new or renovated structure is set up by well-informed artisans in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.
