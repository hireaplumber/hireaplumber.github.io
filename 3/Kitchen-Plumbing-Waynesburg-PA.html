<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing.
