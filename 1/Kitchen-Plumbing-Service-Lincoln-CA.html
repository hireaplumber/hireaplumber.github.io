<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use a growing number of detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
