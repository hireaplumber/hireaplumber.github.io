The majority of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight evenly and might ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
