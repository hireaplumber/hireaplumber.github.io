<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a viable solution, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
