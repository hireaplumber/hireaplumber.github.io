<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

Other excellent choices are overload protection, which turns off the motor if it starts to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the unclean dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal specifically designed to be utilized with a septic system. gives an introduction 1 of waste disposal unit and septic tanks.</p>
