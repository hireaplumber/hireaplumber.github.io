<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
