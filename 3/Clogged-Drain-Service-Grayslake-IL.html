<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific guy. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap builds up down the drain since they typically contain grease and fat. When the fat of the soap combines with mineral water, it sticks and forms a solid residue to the pipes, clogging them. Call and arrange a follow up inspection by an EBMUD Backflow Inspector to validate that assembly is properly installed. The toilet is the most used plumbing fixture in your home. The frequent usage of your toilet suggests that plumbing problems will require your timely attention. We offer professional Jacksonville Toilet Repair and Replacement services, and are on call when you need us.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
