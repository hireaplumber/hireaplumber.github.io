<p>There's a great chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan.

Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
