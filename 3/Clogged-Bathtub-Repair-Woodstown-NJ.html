<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can happen gradually from the buildup of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes. As a clog becomes bigger over time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining correctly. You can combat hard water in numerous ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
