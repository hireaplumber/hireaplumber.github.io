<p>Remember that repiping a home is a significant plumbing repair, and you ought to only employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to guarantee that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs catch moisture so that it doesn't enter the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might survive a drip leg.</p>

Typically handles are toilet parts that get loose or rusty and no longer pull the flap up or drop it pull back effectively.
