<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus provides you an optional Pipe Defense Plan for only $3.95 a month.

<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively easy system, in spite of their importance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that connects with the watering line within your service, where irrigation satisfies the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the movement of water within your system, and avoid any prospective back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This guarantees that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems stays disconnected from clean" water.</p>
