They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
