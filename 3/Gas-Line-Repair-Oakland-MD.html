<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide.

Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
