<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another suggestion to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
