Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

Hard water triggers these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to stress over any concerns with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes chores simpler and less annoying for everybody involved.</p>
